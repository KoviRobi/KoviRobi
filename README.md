For a while I was supervising students at Cambridge (St Catharine's College), which I really enjoyed. I supervised

- Complexity Theory
- Computation Theory
- Semantics of Programming Languages
- Concepts of Programming Languages
- Foundations of Computer Science
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Prolog

I also wrote [a register machine emulator](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rmk35/register-machine/register-machine.html) and a [interactive lambda-calculus interpreter you can click through step by step](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rmk35/lambda_calculus/lambda_calculus.html). The latter is also written in a literate style.
